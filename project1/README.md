# Course Project 1 [Microprocessor Theory Course]

## Problem Statement: 
<br>
Design a multi-­‐cycle processor, IITB-­‐RISC, whose instruction set architecture is provided. Use VHDL as HDL to implement. The IITB_RISC is an 8-register, 16 bit computer system. The architecture must be optimized for performance. It should use point-to-point communication infrastructure.

We did this project as a team of 4. 
Team Members: 
- Pranav Sankhe
- Sachin Goyal 
- Srivatsan Shridhar
- Tanya Chaudhary 

Here are the details regarding the exact implementation.


## Details Regarding included code file 

- `control path.vhdl` : Implements the control flow of machine instructions. 

- `datapath.vhdl` : Implements the dataflow of the processor. 

- `testbench_control.vhdl` : A customized testbench to test(debug) the designed control path.
